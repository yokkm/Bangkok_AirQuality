# Bangkok_AirQuality is in crisis

21/01/2020, the air quality still remained at unhealthy level for Bangkok, Thailand and its nearby provinces.
this workbook only satisfy my current interest in data exploratory, forecasting, programming in python 
and the current air pollution situation in Bangkok, Thailand. 

**Remark** - the available air quality data that provided by Pollution Control Department (http://www.aqmthai.com/) can be trace only 1 month back , luckily I found the article from Khun Worasom Kundhikanjana
https://towardsdatascience.com/identifying-the-sources-of-winter-air-pollution-in-bangkok-part-ii-72539f9b767a
she suggest that "historical data can be found in Berkeley Earth website" so, here i am scraping data from Berkeley Earth website.
